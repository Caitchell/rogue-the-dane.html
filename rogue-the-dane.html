  <p>I like to call <em>Rogue</em> my little <strong>big</strong> brother.</p>
  <p>He's my moms dog, but he's the closest thing to a pet I've had in years.</p>
  <p>Rogue is extremely energetic pup.</p>
  <p>He enjoys most things in life, but here are some of his favorite things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nose rubs</li>
    <li>Dancing in front of the fireplace</li>
    <li>Sitting on peoples laps that are <em>2x smaller than he is</em>.</li>
    <li>All of the kisses and rubs he can get.</li>
    <li>Any and every squeeker toy he can get his paws on.</li>
  </ul>
